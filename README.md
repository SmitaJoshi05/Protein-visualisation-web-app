‚¨ÜÔ∏è PROTEIN VISUALISATION WEB-APP
```

The Protein Visualization Web-App allows users to upload protein molecule files in XYZ format and customize various visualization parameters. Users can interact with a sidebar containing options to toggle outline, bonds, adjust bond scale, brightness, relative atom scale, and bond shade. The application provides real-time rendering of the molecule based on the selected parameters, allowing users to dynamically explore different visual representations.

## Further Reading

The implementation of the Protein Visualization Web-App utilizes Streamlit for building the web interface and ‚Äòst_speckmol‚Äô library for molecular visualization. The code is structured into modules for handling file input, configuring visualization parameters, and rendering the molecule.
Key components of the implementation include:
i.	Integration with Streamlit's sidebar for user interaction.
ii.	Utilization of st_speckmol's ‚Äòspec_plot‚Äô function for molecule visualization.
iii.	Parsing and processing of XYZ format molecule files.
iv.	Dynamic updating of the visualization based on user-selected parameters.
